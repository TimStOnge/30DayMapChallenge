# 30DayMapChallenge

In November 2019, I took part in the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/30DayMapChallenge?src=hashtag_click) on Twitter, in which cartographers and map nerds around the world created and shared one map every day (or close to it) for the full month. The challenge was kicked off by [Topi Tjukanov](https://twitter.com/tjukanov), who set out [map themes for each day](https://twitter.com/tjukanov/status/1187713840550744066).

I accepted the challenge to engage with more creative cartography, interact with other participants, experiment with a wide array of datasets, and hone my skills with [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/), which is what I used to create most of the maps. From [Day 1](https://twitter.com/TimStOnge/status/1190752827729227782) to [Day 30](https://twitter.com/TimStOnge/status/1201275141818404866), the rapid-fire nature of the challenge made for sometimes hectic mapping: scrambling to come up with map ideas, hunting for data, and trying to bring it all together before I was due to tackle the next theme. But in the end, it was worth it to flex some mapping muscle and complete the mission!

The maps are available in this repo and outlined in the list below. This was entirely a personal project done for fun, and the maps are not to be taken as authoritative or finished products ([in case that's not obvious...](https://twitter.com/TimStOnge/status/1195777011752603649)). But if you have any questions or comments about them, feel free to [drop me a line!](https://twitter.com/TimStOnge/)
